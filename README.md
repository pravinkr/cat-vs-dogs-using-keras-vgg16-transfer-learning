Implementing Transfer learning on VGG16 pre-trained model for cat-vs-dogs dataset

With 50 epocs on transfer learning with VGG-16 pre-trained weights on dcat-vs -dogs dataset, the model gave an accuracy of 99.7% on the validation set.

This is a tremondous improvement as the same model trained on same dataset from scratch was not able to go beyond 65% accuracy.
